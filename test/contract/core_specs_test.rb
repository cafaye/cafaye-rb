# The contract with core, read from core's own files rather than paraphrased.
#
# Every pattern this library enforces is a copy of something in
# `cafaye/core/schemas/event-envelope.schema.json` or in the table block in
# `cafaye/core/docs/event-outbox.md`. A copy is a duplicate that can drift, so
# it is checked: when `core` is on disk — a sibling checkout, or a CI job that
# clones it — this test compares the library's patterns to core's and compares
# the reference DDL's column list to the table in core's doc.
#
# ## There is no `skip` here, on purpose
#
# When core is not on disk the test falls back to the pinned copy in
# `test/fixtures/core_envelope.rb` and still asserts: that the pinned copy is
# present, that the library agrees with it, and that the fallback was actually
# used. A test that skips tells the next reader nothing about whether the
# contract is being enforced; a test that asserts against a pinned copy and
# *reports* that it is doing so tells them exactly how much is being checked.
#
# `bin/prime` in this worktree has core on disk, so the real comparison runs.
# CI checks the two newest Ruby versions, one of which clones core so the real
# comparison runs there too.
