# `cafaye.yml` is the one place that declares this repository's identity, its core
# constraint and who owns it, and `core`'s schema is `additionalProperties:
# false` — so a field core does not define is a validation failure, not a
# comment. A manifest that drifts is a manifest `caf new` and `pantry` read as
# fact and are wrong about.
#
# Core ships no JSON Schema validator and neither does this gem — a validator is a
# dependency that has to earn its place, and for five constraints it does not earn
# one. What is checked is each constraint core states, against core's own file
# where core is on disk, so the check cannot drift from the schema the way a
# hand-copied pattern can.
