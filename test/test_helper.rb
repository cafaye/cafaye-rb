  # The floor starts at 60% on the bootstrap commit — the gem is four lines and a
  # file of error classes at that point, and a floor of 90% over that would only
  # be asserting that the repository does not yet contain the library. It is
  # raised at every deliverable commit, and the trajectory is recorded in
  # AGENTS.md: 60% at bootstrap, 90% with the verifier, 95% with the outbox.

  # to make a build green, is not — a threshold that moves down is a gate that
  # stopped being a gate.
