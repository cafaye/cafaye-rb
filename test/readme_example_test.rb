# The README's examples, run.
#
# "A usage example that runs" is a claim, and a claim in a README is worth
# exactly as much as the test that proves it. Every code block in README.md that
# can be executed without a running identity is executed here, against a real
# PostgreSQL, and the assertions are the ones the prose makes.
#
# What cannot be executed is the one thing that needs a live identity: fetching
# the key set over the network. For that the suite runs a real JWKS server on a
# real socket (`test/support/jwks_server.rb`), which is the same code path with a
# different origin — so this file covers the parts a reader would otherwise have
# to take on trust, and the verifier suite covers the fetch.
