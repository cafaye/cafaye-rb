#
# WHAT THIS IS FOR
#
# A `gate.yml` that has only ever been read by a checker that said yes is a
# description, not a gate. This script takes the repository as it stands, copies
# it nineteen times, breaks exactly one thing in each copy, and asserts the
# checker goes red AND names the finding it expects. Every breakage names the
# finding rather than accepting "something went red", because "something went
# red" is a claim that decays silently and "this check is still load-bearing" is
# the one worth making.
#
# The shape is core's `harness/tests/gate_self_test.sh`, and it is the same shape
# for the same reasons: a CONTROL on the unmodified repository runs first,
# because nineteen reds against a repository nobody checked prove nothing at all;
# every breakage gets a fresh throwaway copy, so one can never mask the next; and
# nothing in the committed tree is a deliberately broken repository — the
# breakages are diffs applied here, so a reviewer reads what is being broken
# rather than having to reconstruct it.
#
# EIGHT OF THE NINETEEN BREAK THE GATE, AND THEY ARE THE ONES THAT MATTER
#
# Eleven breakages edit one line in `gate.yml` or in the CI workflow, and the
# checker's static half catches each in under a second. The other eight break
# `bin/prime` or the suite itself and can only be seen by RUNNING the gate: a
# gate that exits 0 having done nothing (7), a gate that runs the suite, watches
# it fail and exits 0 anyway (8), a suite that quietly lost a tier (9), a test
# that starts skipping itself (10), a linter that stops running (12), an audit
# that stops running (13), a database step that stops running (14), and a floor
# set above what the suite reports (15). Those are the false green and its
# cousins, and a declaration that cannot catch them is a comment.
#
# WHAT IT IS NOT
#
# It does not prove the suite touched the database it claims to. A proof is a
# line of output, and a collect-then-run set diff is `caf`'s job, named in core's
# harness/gate_findings.json under `notEnforced`. It is deliberately NOT wired
# into `bin/prime`: a self-test inside every gate invocation would be a second
# gate that can disagree with the first. It belongs in CI as a step of its own.
#
# COUNTS
#
# Passes and skips are reported separately, always, and a warning case is
# counted as its own kind of thing again: `gate.requirement-unproven` is a claim
# this machine did not settle, it is printed, and it does not move the exit code.
