  # Captures whatever the library writes to any logger, so the canary test can
  # assert on the rendered text rather than on a list of attribute names.
  #
  # Asserting attribute-by-attribute only proves the filter catches the names
  # somebody already thought of. The canary string is a value, and the only
  # assertion that survives is the one over the whole rendered output: every
  # message, at every level, through whatever logger the library happens to
  # reach. That is why this hooks the logger rather than a method — a library
  # that logs through `warn` and one that logs through `info` are both caught,
  # and one that adds a new destination later is caught the first time it runs.
