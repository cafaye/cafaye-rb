  # Real, because the honest way to test signature verification is with real
  # keys: mocking the `jwt` gem would test the mock, and a verifier that has
  # only ever seen a fake RSA key has never been asked to reject a forged
  # signature. `testKey` is guard's `test/jwksServer.ts` idea in Ruby — mint a
  # key pair, publish the public half in the shape a JWKS carries, keep the
  # private half in this process and never let it out.

  # would spend more time in the RSA keygen than in the assertion.

    # identity will never ship.
