# The publisher loop: the thing that moves committed rows to a transport.
#
# Two claims are load-bearing, and both are tested here against a real
# PostgreSQL with two live connections, because neither is a property of this
# code:
#
# - **`for update skip locked`** is what lets N replicas run this loop against
#   one table. A row another publisher is holding is skipped, not blocked on, so
#   a slow batch in one replica cannot stall the rest.
# - **Ack, then mark.** `published_at` is set from the transport's
#   acknowledgement, never before. A publish that was never acknowledged is an
#   unpublished row and the next pass republishes it — same `id`, so a consumer
#   that already got it ignores the duplicate.
