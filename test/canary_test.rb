# THE CANARY.
#
# This file is the packet's security constraint, so it is worth being explicit
# about what is being claimed.
#
# A token is a credential. Everything inside one — the compact serialisation, the
# `sub`, whatever else identity has decided to put in there — is text that ends
# up somewhere it should not. Adding verification adds a new destination for
# exactly that text: this library's logger, and the exception messages a host
# application logs, prints into a `problem+json` body, or pastes into an issue.
# So "we do not log the token" has to become "there is no path from a token to a
# log line", and the only thing that survives future changes is a test that fails
# when that path appears.
#
# The canary is a unique string placed in a claim, and the assertion is on the
# **rendered output of the logger sink** — every line, at every level, as one
# string. Asserting key by key would only prove a filter catches the names
# somebody already thought of.
#
# It is asserted both ways, and the order matters. First that the canary is
# genuinely in the input, so the test cannot pass vacuously — an empty log and a
# verifier that never saw the claim look identical from one side. Then that it is
# absent from the output. Then the specific dangerous properties, because
# "the canary is absent" and "the key material is absent" are different claims
# and only the first is about a value the attacker chose.
#
# The method here is muse's, from `muse/tests/test_trace_propagation.py`: a
# canary in the input, asserted *present* first, and a whole-payload assertion
# rather than a per-field one.
class CanaryTest < TestSupport::Test
  # A string that must not survive anywhere. It appears in a claim of a token
  # this process really signs and really verifies, and nowhere else, so a hit in
  # the output is unambiguous.
