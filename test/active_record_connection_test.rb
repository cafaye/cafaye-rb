# The Active Record adapter, against a real Active Record connection to a real
# PostgreSQL.
#
# The whole reason this adapter exists is the one property a second `PG::Connection`
# could never have: **the insert has to be on the connection that is inside the
# caller's transaction.** Two connections, one database, and the event commits on
# its own while the domain row rolls back — which is the exact failure the outbox
# exists to prevent, wearing the costume of a correct implementation. So these
# tests are about enlistment, and the rollback one is the load-bearing test in the
# whole file.
