# The envelope, which is core's `schemas/event-envelope.schema.json` and not
# this library's opinion of it.
#
# Every pattern in `Cafaye::Outbox::Envelope` is copied from core's schema, and
# `test/contract/core_specs_test.rb` asserts the copies are the same grammar.
# The duplication is the point: a malformed type is refused at the one place
# that wrote it rather than at every consumer on the platform, and that only
# works if the writer holds the same grammar core does.
