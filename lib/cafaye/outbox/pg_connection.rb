    # This is the seam that makes the transactional guarantee testable and
    # portable. The writer needs three things from a connection — "are you in a
    # transaction", "insert this row", "give me these statements" — and the
    # first one is the one that matters. Depending on Active Record instead would
    # make a non-Rails service inherit an ORM to move one row, and would make
    # the rollback guarantee untestable outside Rails.
    #
    # Every statement goes through `exec_params`, never string interpolation. The
    # only interpolated SQL here is the `quote_ident` for a database name in the
    # test harness; the outbox statements are fully parameterised, and the
    # service name never reaches SQL at all.

      # `PQTRANS_UNKNOWN` is what a connection that has not run a statement yet
      # reports, and `PQTRANS_INERROR` is a failed transaction whose statements
      # are being ignored until it is rolled back — writing into one succeeds at
      # the protocol level and vanishes at the rollback, which is the worst of
      # both answers. An earlier version asked "is it not idle", which made a
      # brand-new connection look like it was inside a transaction and quietly
      # disabled the one check the table depends on.

      # replica cannot stall the rest.
      #
      # The backoff predicate is core's rule — "attempts grows, the wait grows
      # with it" — expressed against core's fixed column list. There is no
      # `next_attempt_at` column and this library does not add one: the column
      # list is a contract, and `created_at` is the one instant every row
      # definitely has. An event that sat unpublished for an hour still has the
      # `created_at` it was written with, so the schedule stays correct.
      #
      # `now` is a parameter rather than the database's `now()` so that the
      # publisher's clock is the only clock. A loop that evaluated its own
      # schedule against a different clock than the one it inserts timestamps
      # with is a loop whose backoff is a function of clock skew.
      #
      # The backoff for a row at zero attempts is **zero seconds**: a row that
      # has never been published is due now, and a first attempt held back for a
      # second is a first attempt that was delayed for no reason. After one
      # failure the wait is one second, then two, then four — core's "1s, 2s,
      # 4s, … capped".
