    # The outbox table, over an Active Record connection.
    #
    # The same statements as `PgConnection`, issued through Active Record's
    # adapter instead of the `pg` driver directly. It exists because of the one
    # requirement the outbox has and that a second connection could never meet:
    # **the insert has to be on the connection that is inside the caller's
    # transaction.** A `Pg::Connection` opened from the same database config is
    # a different session, is not enlisted, and would commit the event on its own
    # — which is the exact failure the table exists to prevent, wearing the
    # costume of a correct implementation.
    #
    # So this adapter takes the connection *pool* and asks it for the connection
    # Active Record is currently leasing, rather than opening one.
